  <h1>Benefits of Jenkins Shared Library</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> A Jenkins Shared Library allows you to centralize and reuse common code, functions, and utilities across multiple Jenkins pipelines. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier to maintain and update shared logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> By using a Shared Library, you ensure that consistent practices and standards are followed across different pipelines. This helps in maintaining a uniform approach to tasks like building, testing, and deploying software.</li>
    <li><strong>Version Control System (Centralized Control System):</strong> Shared Libraries are typically stored in a version control system (e.g., Git), providing a centralized location for managing the library code. This enables versioning, collaboration, and easy tracking of changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Faster Development:</strong> With a Shared Library, developers can leverage pre-built functions and steps, reducing the time spent on writing repetitive code. This speeds up the pipeline development process and improves overall efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Shared Libraries allow you to enforce standardized practices, coding conventions, and best practices across all pipelines that use the library. This helps maintain a high level of quality and consistency in your CI/CD processes.</li>
